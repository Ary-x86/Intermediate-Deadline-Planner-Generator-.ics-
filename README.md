# ChatGPT said this about my code
This code is a study deadline planner that helps users break down their study material into manageable, intermediate deadlines. By setting a final exam date and specifying the number of lectures, chapters, or parts to cover, the code calculates a schedule with equally spaced deadlines to ensure consistent progress.

---------------------------------------------------------
Key Features:

Input Collection: Prompts the user to specify their subject, the type of material division (e.g., chapters or lectures), and the number of divisions.

Deadline Calculation: Using the current date and exam date, it calculates the total days available, divides them evenly, and sets deadlines for each part of the study material.

Event Creation: Generates individual events for each deadline, complete with a unique name and due date.

Export to ICS: Allows the user to save the schedule as an .ics file that can be imported into calendar applications, like Google Calendar, for easy tracking.

This tool is ideal for creating structured study plans with intermediate goals, helping users stay on track as they prepare for exams.
